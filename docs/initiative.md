There is a need for a demo that reflects Videa's production system look and feel and will be flexible enough to show customers real scenarios and experiences.

## What for?

- Training (Internal / External)
- Conferences
- New Client Demos (Sales)
- Product Support

## Why this approach?

- Will represent the true value of the platform and allow for data to flow without violation of using stations real data.
- Stand-alone environment â€“ independent of release management cycle
- Stable environment where screens and workflow are consistent
- Supports UX teams and provides ample time for usability testing
- Supports product council feedback in a timely manner
- Helps scrum teams clearly understand product requirements / workflow
- HTML Code can be repurposed to help rapid dev within sprints
- Responsive design


## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pending Orders (accept / reject) should reflect production workflow of when a stations accepts and rejects and order
2. Pending MG workflow will reflect six scenarios:
  -  MG
  -  Credit
  -  Bonus
  -  Program Change
  -  MG Pre-empt
  -  Missed Spots
3. Open Pre-empts should reflect production workflow
4. Order Search should reflect production workflow
